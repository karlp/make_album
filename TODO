bugs:

pod is out of date :(

suffix stripping is dumb for movies

should do a better job of not reencoding pngs? or magic strings to not resize?

http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/map?output_home is one way of making gpx to
maps?

look at http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/examples/google_gpx.html
or just view-source:http://www.obviously.com/gis/gpx_loader.html
